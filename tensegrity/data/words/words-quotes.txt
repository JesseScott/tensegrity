“I dance to know who I am”
“We listen to the body”
“Very important to honour the self” 
“My feet brought me here”
“It creates energy” 
“Free spirit, no judgment, just be”
“Keeps the blood flowing”
“When I arrived I was almost asleep, but now I am awake!”
“This dance is a healing practice”
“This dance takes away right and wrong”
“You learn to understand the body”
“Everyone has something to share”
“To make the space clean and sacred, we meditate, study”
“Animal forms”
