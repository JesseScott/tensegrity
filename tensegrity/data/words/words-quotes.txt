“I dance to know who I am”
“Everyone has something to share”
“Free spirit, no judgment, just be”
“Very important to honor the self” 
“This dance is a healing practice”
“Keeps the blood flowing”
“It creates energy” 
“This dance takes away right and wrong”
“We listen to the body”
“To make the space clean and sacred, we meditate, study”
“When I arrived I was almost asleep, but now I am awake!”
