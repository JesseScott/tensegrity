We honour the self
This dance takes away right and wrong
Helps build confidence
Positive effect of this practice on my feet
Its very positive work
You learn to understand the body
This dance is a healing practice
My feet brought me here,\nfeet rooted in aboriginal dance
Animal forms
Very relaxing, this dance
To make the space clean, sacred,\nwe meditate, study
We listen to the body
Helping me with osteoporosis
Every one had something to share
Free spirit, no judgment, just be
It was fun
Helps us take away right or wrong
Necessary, very important to honour the self
When i arrived i was almost asleep,\nbut now iâ€™m awake!
Keeps the blood flowing
Really enjoyed it, it creates energy
