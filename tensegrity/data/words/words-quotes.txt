“I dance to know who I am”
“We listen to the body”
“Very important to honour the self” 
“It creates energy” 
“Free spirit, no judgment, just be”
“When I arrived I was almost asleep, but now I am awake!”
“This dance is a healing practice”
“This dance takes away right and wrong”
“Everyone has something to share”
“To make the space clean and sacred, we meditate, study”
“Keeps the blood flowing”
